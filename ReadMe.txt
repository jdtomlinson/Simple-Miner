About:
Simple Miner is a open world voxel game inspired by Minecraft.
The world of Simple Miner is procedurally generated and naturally
consists of two types of blocks: stone and dirt. Players can dig up
existing blocks or place their own, including glow stone blocks,
which light up dark areas. Simple Miner also has a day/night cycle,
where the world is darker during the night. Changes that players
have made to the world are saved and show up every time the game
is loaded again. Simple Miner was written in C++ and was completed
over a 2.5 month period.
